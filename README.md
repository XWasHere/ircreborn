# IrcReborn

## What Is This

well. ircreborn was created because i felt that all the good platforms had too many paywalled features.

## Install

### Linux (pacman)

to install ircreborn using pacman, just download one of the packages from the releases, then install it with `pacman -U (filename)`. you can also build the package from source using makepkg

### Linux (make)

installing on linux should hopefully be pretty easy. you'll need libxcb installed

```
make binit
make
make install
```

### Windows

to install on windows, just download ircreborn-win32.exe from the releases. you dont really need to install anything it should work out of the box.
